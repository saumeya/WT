<p>
A snap hunt is one of many different types of games with two or three players who try to find objects or places by following a series of clues. And after finding the place we have to take photo along with that place. Snap hunt games may be an indoor or outdoor activity. Outdoors it can be played in a garden, indoors it can be played in a specific room, which would make the work of hiding the clues harder.
